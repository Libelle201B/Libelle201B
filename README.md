- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Libelle201B
I'm a retired former FORTRAN, COBOL, RPG, VB, VB.NET coder.

My current project is to create a web site for a flying club that I belong to.  The site will be used primarily to schedule aircraft and people on flying days.  
The site should also have a page for history of the club,  a page for sharing images and videos, and a FAQ page for potential members.
